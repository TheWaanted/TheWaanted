### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
It's good to see you arround here! My name is JoÃ£o Castro, but people call me **TheWaanted_** or just **TW**. I'm a Game Designer with arround four years of experience. Currently I'm working at **Rede Sky**, the largest Minecraft network of Brazil.

I also have a little bit of **Java** knowledge, so once in a while you can check here for some of my personal projects, like my [open source Bed Wars plugin](https://github.com/TheWaanted/BedWars). ðŸ˜‰
